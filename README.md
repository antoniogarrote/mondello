## Developing

The application is written in ScalaJS and it uses Electron for the user interface.

To build the application run

```bash
sbt electronMain
```

You can leave sbt running in the background and looking for changes using the command:

```bash
sbt ~electronMain
```

At the same time you can start the application to see the result of the changes in your code using the binary Electron distribution, you will also need to pass the `ENV=development` environment variable to see traces and the development tools:

```bash
ENV=development /path/to/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron /path/to/mondello/electron-app/main.js 
```
Once Electron opens with the application you can just select `reload` from the menu every time you make changes.

To package the OSX app use the `package.sh` script:

```bash
./package.sh
```

After building the app you can create a dmg package using the `build.sh` script:

```bash
./build.sh
```
